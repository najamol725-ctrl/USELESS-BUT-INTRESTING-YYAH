### Project Description
Ice Melting Simulation is an interactive web app that simulates how an ice cube melts when the temperature increases. Users can adjust the temperature using a slider, and the ice image responds by fading and shrinking â€” just like real melting. An AI voice assistant also reacts and speaks based on the temperature level.



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
